Repository for my Scripts.
My main task is using coan - the preprocessor chainsaw on Linux and document on what happens.
The Scripts inside this repository are either my main scripts, that use coan recursively or compare preprocessor outputs if they're the same, or my tools or prototypes that i used to solve problems with my main scripts.
